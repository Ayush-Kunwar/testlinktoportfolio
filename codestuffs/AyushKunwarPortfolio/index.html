        <h2>üìú About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I was born in Nepal, Kathmandu on the 18th of April, 2006. Nepal is a beautiful country with a bright sun that causes sinister shadows. I grew to the age of 4 in Nepal, living with my grandparents (as my parents had gone to England in pursuit of better quality of life). I moved to England in 2011. Currently, I am situated in Plymouth, Devon and attend Devonport High School for Boys as a sixth former.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am taking 3 A levels at DHSB: Maths, Physics and Computer Science. My aims for the future are pretty vague, however, I would love to pursue a carreer in the technology/software. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Currently, I am still a beginner at programming and am in the process of learning new concepts and idealogies. Being an A-level student, I am in the process of creating a habit of working in a more linear and algorithmic style. This allow me to work with those who are perhaps more enlightened in the world of programming. I am also looking into cloud computing as it seems very complex and interesting to me.

        <h2>üë©üèΩ‚ÄçüöÄ Projects</h2>

        <p>
          I have started by OCR A-level Computer Science Project, which needs to be planned, completed and presented next year. The project requires for a concise and effective solution to a problem-oriented scenario using software that is original. My plan is to create a website using THREE Javascript (which has been used to create this very website) and embed a game into it. This game should essentially show off my programming skills as well as function as a portfolio.
        </p>

        <h2>üèÜ Accomplishments</h2>

        <p>
          I am predicted to achieve 3 A+ in my A levels due to my exceptional GCSE results (9 Nines, 2 Eights). I am also working to achieve my GOLD Duke of Edinborough award. During the COVID season, I was part of the DHSB team that competed in the UK Mathematical Trust's Team Maths Challenge, we made it to the finals in London, but unfortunately COVID put an end to that journey.

        <h2>üåÆ Work/Volunteer History</h2>

        <h3>Private Tutor</h3>
        <p>
          During the summer holidays, I helped tutor multiple primary-school children in preparation for the 11 plus. I am proud to have helped shape a budding childhood and I was able to guide many children to passing the 11+, which allowed them to secure a place at prestigious grammar schools.
        </p>
        <h3>Library Services</h3>
        <p>
          I believe that the library is a wonderful invention. As a child, I visited the Library often and wanted to give back to the community. As well as this, I also participated in the Duke of Edinborough Award, which required at least a year in volunteering, so I decided to help at the Library. This volunteering experience has helped me develop skills to multitask in a busy, social environment and work with all ages from 1 to 80+.
